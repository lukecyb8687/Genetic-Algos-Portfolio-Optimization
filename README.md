# Genetic-Algos-Portfolio-Optimization

The notebook details the genetic optimization process of maximizing the Sharpe Ratio, using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm, and the Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII). The notebook then compares the results across all 3 solvers, as well as the convergence time needed.
